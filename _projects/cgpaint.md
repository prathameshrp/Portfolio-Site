cgPaint is a paint app built as a computer graphics mini project. Every
primitive is written from scratch — no `ctx.lineTo` for lines, no `ctx.arc`
for circles. A configurable step delay lets you slow any algorithm down to
watch it plot pixels one at a time, which makes the theory considerably
easier to follow than pseudocode.

## Why I built it

The algorithms made more sense once I could see them run. Watching Bresenham's
error term flip the step direction is clearer than reading about it.

## Highlights

- DDA and Bresenham line algorithms with visible per-pixel error term tracking.
- Bresenham circle using 8-fold symmetry — one octant computed, seven mirrored.
- Scan-line polygon fill: click to place vertices, finish to sweep and fill row by row.
- Canvas polygon clipping via `ctx.clip()` on a user-drawn region.
- Per-object translate, rotate, and scale with `ctx.save`/`ctx.restore` isolation.
- Speed slider (0–100ms per pixel) turns every algorithm into a live step visualizer.
