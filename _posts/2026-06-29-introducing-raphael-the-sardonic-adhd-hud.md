We've all been there. You sit down to write code or update a doc. You open a browser tab to check a reference, and twenty minutes later you're deep in a Wikipedia rabbit hole reading about medieval trebuchet engineering.

Standard website blockers don't work for engineers or power users — they're too easy to disable, too rigid, and completely context-blind. Block Chrome and you lose everything: the critical docs page *and* the social media feed you were trying to avoid.

That's why I built **Raphael**.

Raphael is a sardonically supportive **ADHD cognitive advisor** that integrates directly into your Linux desktop as a cockpit-style HUD. It watches your active workspace context, dynamically categorizes your behavior using an LLM pipeline, calls out focus slippages with ruthless wit, and locks your screen with interactive psychological challenges when you drift too far off track.

## Core Architecture

Raphael splits its footprint between a lightweight desktop layer and a background analytics daemon.

**QML HUD Frontend** — A pair of frosted-glass overlay panels (`leftQuotePanel`, `rightInsightPanel`) pinned above your windows using KDE Plasma 6 (Qt Quick/QML). Streams live advisor observations, active telemetry, and your real-time **Focus Efficiency Rating**.

**Flask Core Daemon** — A zero-overhead background engine polling system state every few seconds. Parses active window properties, handles tracking triggers, serves a local analytics dashboard, and fires real-time classification requests against a **Groq AI pipeline**.

---

## Key Features

### Deep Window & Tab Dissection

Most focus trackers read process strings like `google-chrome` or `vscodium` and stop there. Raphael uses direct active window parsing (optimized for XWayland) to extract the **exact browser tab title** or current file path — stripping the application wrapper entirely. It knows the difference between `github.com/pulls` and an entertainment blog.

### The Distraction Challenge

When the polling module detects you've lingered on an unapproved window past your threshold (default: 30 seconds), it overrides your layout with a focus interruption. Not a warning banner — a pop-up that forces you to textually justify your action:

> *"Explain exactly how this tab aids your immediate deployment target, or return to work."*

Session metrics don't resume until you justify the context switch or close the window.

### Dynamic Mid-Session Context Shifting

You don't need to edit config files to change Raphael's behavior mid-session. The integrated **Chat Console** accepts natural language updates on the fly:

- *"Remind me to stretch every 20 minutes."*
- *"From now on, ignore Spotify track changes."*
- *"Escalate the aggression matrix — I'm drifting."*

## Under the Hood: QML Telemetry Sync

The HUD polls the Flask daemon on a tight loop and pushes live data directly into the overlay:

```javascript
function syncNetworkPayload() {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open(
        "GET",
        "http://127.0.0.1:5757/telemetry_v3?caring=" + caringLevel + "&ai_track=" + aiWindowTracking
    );
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE && xhr.status === 200) {
            var res = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);

            sharedState.currentQuote       = res.quote.text;
            sharedState.focusEfficiencyText = (res.efficiency * 100) + "% FOCUS";

            console.log("HUD Matrix Sync Complete // Status: " + res.status);
        }
    };
    xhr.send();
}
```

## Web Telemetry Dashboard

The Flask daemon also hosts a full session dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:5757/dashboard`, built with **Chart.js**:

- **Focus Timeline** — Minute-by-minute view charting active focus against distractions.
- **Window Breakdown** — Doughnut graph showing time distribution across file paths, browser tabs, and applications.
- **Session Goals** — Checkable goal metrics generated at session start.

## Getting Started

Requirements: **KDE Plasma 6.0+** and a valid Groq API key.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/prathameshrp/Raphael.git
cd Raphael

# Set your API key
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Launch daemon
./run.sh
```
